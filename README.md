# STA309_Midterm2
Take-home midterm for STA309.

For this dashboard on dairy production and consumption around the world, there is a focus on summarizing averages from 1962-2022 across the world. There are two maps showing average dairy production and consumption with a scale to show which countries are higher or lower producers and consumers. To explore the relationship between dairy production and consumption, there is a scatter plot with a linear regression line showing how much a country produces relates to average consumption over time.

Taylor Swift Dashboard showing the difference between Reputation and Speak Now. With the word clouds, there is insight into the themes and topics covered in each album and some similarities in the lyrics. In the sentiment analysis, the positive and negative words are pretty much equal, however Reputation has more positive words which can be misleading. Using Spotify metadata most of the songs between the two albums have a similarity in danceability and energy. However, Reputation has more songs concentrated around a high energy whereas Speak Now has more variability with energy.
